## Outils 

addr6: An IPv6 address analysis and manipulation tool.
blackhole6: A troubleshooting tool which can find IPv6 where in the network topology packets with specific IPv6 Extension Headers are being dropped.
flow6: A tool to perform a security asseessment of the IPv6 Flow Label.
frag6: A tool to perform IPv6 fragmentation-based attacks and to perform a security assessment of a number of fragmentation-related aspects.
icmp6: A tool to perform attacks based on ICMPv6 error messages.
jumbo6: A tool to assess potential flaws in the handling of IPv6 Jumbograms.
na6: A tool to send arbitrary Neighbor Advertisement messages.
ni6: A tool to send arbitrary ICMPv6 Node Information messages, and assess possible flaws in the processing of such packets.
ns6: A tool to send arbitrary Neighbor Solicitation messages.
path6: A versatile IPv6-based traceroute tool (which supports extension headers, IPv6 fragmentation, and other features not present in existing traceroute implementations).
